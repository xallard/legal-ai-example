# In this script:

# A CaseOutcomePredictor class is defined, handling data loading, model training, and prediction.
# The script uses RandomForestClassifier, a machine learning model suitable for classification tasks. This can be replaced with any other appropriate model depending on the complexity and nature of the data.
# Functions are provided for loading data, training the model, and making predictions on new case data.
# Example usage at the bottom of the script demonstrates how the class can be utilized.
# This file, as part of the LegalAI project's outcome-predictor module, would serve as a crucial component in providing predictive analytics for legal cases, aiding legal professionals in decision-making and strategy planning.
